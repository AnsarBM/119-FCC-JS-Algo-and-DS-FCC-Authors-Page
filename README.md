In this project we learn "Fetch and Promises". 

The 3 lessons from this project are;
      1) How to fetch data from an external API, then work with asynchronous JavaScript.
      2) How to use the fetch method, then dynamically update the DOM to display the fetched data.
      3) How to paginate your data so you can load results in batches. Say 8 sets at a time.
